# Surfs Up Weather Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this project was to determine if a combination surf shop/ice cream store would be a sustainable business through out the year on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. To determine this temperature data over the period of several years was used to compare the weather in the month of June to that of the month of December.

## Results:
Below are the results of the analysis:

June weather statistics:

There are several differences in the temperature statistics for June and Decemeber.
- The average temperature in June is 3.9 degrees higher Decemeber.
- The minimum temperature in December is significantly lower than June by 8 degrees.
- Although the max temperature is only different by 2 degrees the percentale cut-offs in December are further away from each other than the ones in June, suggesting there are more days that are on closer to the temperature minimum in Decemember thatn there are in June. This observation is also supported by the increased SD seen in December.

## Summary:
Based on avearege temperature, the business venture should see very little change in customer volume. It would be recommended to carry wetsuits for those days in Decemember where the temperature is cooler than the ideal. Additional analysis of precipitation should be performed to determine if there is a rainy season, after which a comparison between the temperatures of the rainy season and non-rainy season should be compared to see if the change in temparture would be significant. Statistical analysis of the quantity of rainy days would be helpful in determining how often the store would see a decrease in customer volume.
